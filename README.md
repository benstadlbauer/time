# `time`
### A simple HTML-based clock display

I wanted to have a fullscreen clock for my dual-screen setup for a longer time. Since I have "learned" the basics of HTML and Javascript i decided to write my own little fullscreen-clock. After that I decided to make it available for others, so I added a help-function (press `h`) and after some refactoring I put it on GitHub.

There are at least a dozen more features in my head I could implement but this is what I have so far. And I don't know if this will work on your computer (regarding the browser, your keyboard-language etc).
