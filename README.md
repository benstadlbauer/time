# `time`
### A simple HTML-based clock display

Press `h` to show the hotkeys:
- `Space` sweeps through clock-displays
- `c` toggles the colors
- `+` increases size
- `-` decreases size
- `0` resets size

I wanted to have a fullscreen clock for my dual-screen setup for a longer time. After I have learned the very basics of HTML and Javascript, I decided to write my own little fullscreen-clock. Afterwards I decided to make it available for others, so I added a help-function (press `h`) and after some refactoring I put it on GitHub.

There are at least a dozen more features in my head I could implement but this is what I have so far. And I don't know if this will work on your computer (regarding the browser, your keyboard-language etc).
