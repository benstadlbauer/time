== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.

# `time`
### A simple HTML-based clock display

Press `h` to show the hotkeys:
- `Space` sweeps through clock-displays
- `c` and `shift-c` sweeps through the color-schemes
- `+` increases size
- `-` decreases size
- `0` resets size
- `s` shows settings

I wanted to have a fullscreen clock for my dual-screen setup for a longer time. After I have learned the very basics of HTML and Javascript, I decided to write my own little fullscreen-clock. After I decided to make it available for others, I added a help-function (press `h`) and after some refactoring I put it on GitHub.

There are at least a dozen more features in my head I could implement but this is what I have so far. And I don't know if this will work on your computer (regarding the browser, your keyboard-language etc).

I will try to keep this tiny application updated and I hopefully I will continue adding more features.
